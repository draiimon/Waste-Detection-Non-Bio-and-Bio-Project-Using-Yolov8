Waste Detection: Biodegradable and Non-Biodegradable Classification Using YOLOv8
1. Introduction
Effective waste management is a critical challenge faced by urban areas worldwide. The rapid increase in population and industrial activities has led to substantial waste generation, posing significant environmental and health risks. Proper segregation of waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories is essential for sustainable waste management, recycling, and reduction of landfill usage. Traditional manual waste segregation methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human error. To address these challenges, this project leverages advanced computer vision techniques to automate the classification of waste materials, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in waste management systems.

2. Project Objectives

4. Methodology
a. Data Collection and Preparation
Dataset Compilation: Gather a comprehensive dataset comprising images of various waste items categorized into biodegradable and non-biodegradable classes. Sources may include publicly available datasets, collaborations with recycling centers, and manual collection.

Annotation: Label each waste item in the images using bounding boxes, specifying the class (biodegradable or non_biodegradable). Tools like LabelImg or Roboflow can facilitate this process.

Data Augmentation: Apply augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and color adjustments to increase dataset diversity and improve model robustness.

b. Model Training
Environment Setup: Utilize a Python-based environment with necessary libraries, including ultralytics, torch, and opencv-python.

Training Process: Employ YOLOv8 to train the model on the annotated dataset, adjusting hyperparameters such as epochs, batch size, and image size based on hardware capabilities.

Optimization: Implement techniques like mixed precision training and batch size adjustments to enhance training speed and efficiency.

c. Model Evaluation and Validation
Performance Metrics: Assess the model using metrics like Precision, Recall, mAP (mean Average Precision), and F1-Score to evaluate classification accuracy and detection performance.

Validation Set Testing: Validate the model on a separate dataset to ensure generalization and prevent overfitting.

Error Analysis: Analyze misclassifications to identify potential areas for improvement in data collection or model tuning.

d. Deployment and Real-Time Detection
Integration: Deploy the trained YOLOv8 model into a real-time detection system using a webcam or video feed.
